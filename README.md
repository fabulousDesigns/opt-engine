# OptEngine

> Optimize your code by understanding how runtime engines work under the hood.

OptEngine is a developer tool that analyzes your JavaScript/TypeScript code to identify performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations aligned with V8 engine internals. By bridging the knowledge gap between how developers write code and how engines optimize it, OptEngine helps developers write faster, more efficient applications.

## üöß Project Status

This project is currently in early development. Star and watch this repository to stay updated on our progress!

## üîç Key Features (Planned)

- **Static code analysis** for V8 optimization barriers
- **Actionable recommendations** with clear explanations
- **Educational insights** about engine internals
- **IDE integration** for real-time feedback
- **CI/CD integration** for automated performance checking

## üìä Optimization Categories

OptEngine will analyze your code for the following optimization opportunities:

### Type Consistency

- Hidden class preservation
- Polymorphic operation detection
- Type transition minimization

### Function Optimization

- Inline-friendly function patterns
- Deoptimization trigger detection
- Hot function optimization

### Object & Property Access

- Efficient property access patterns
- Object shape consistency
- Prototype chain optimizations

### Memory Management

- Allocation rate detection
- Closure variables optimization
- Array and buffer optimizations

### Control Flow

- Hot path optimization
